<img src="//gravatar.com/avatar/533b687cf97f813c620703e41c215fd7?s=160" class="align-left" />I'm Michael Wales, a Full Stack Web Developer and Open Source Advocate. I live in San Antonio, TX, with my girlfriend (Daniele), our two children (Zach and Tiara) and our two dogs (Bella and Leia). I enjoy all things technology related, from programming and web design to car audio and hobby electronics. If I'm not busy working from my home office (or the local coffee shop), you'll most likely find me playing video games or catching up on my favorite TV shows and movies.

I'm currently a Senior Associate with Kforce Government Solutions where I develop web-based applications for multiple government and commercial contracts. In recent years, my Top Secret/SCI security clearance has provided opportunities to contribute to the Department of Homeland Security, Defense Intelligence Agency, National Security Agency and the Department of Veterans Affairs. [My resume](/resume/) is available and details this work in addition to my enlistment in the U.S. Air Force.

I'm also Co-Founder and CTO of [StudentsGoneGlobal](http://studentsgoneglobal.com/), a social network for the student traveller that is currently rebranding and expanding our target demographic.
